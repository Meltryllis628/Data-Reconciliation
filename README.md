# Data Reconciliation

## Description

Consider a CSV file that stores a list of records (e.g., records of bank accounts).
You are required to write a software program that reads two such CSV files, compares records
stored in these CSV files row by row against a unique combination and records all mismatches
as exceptions. Finally, the software program generates another csv file listing the exceptions.

## Example

Consider customer files that contain customer id, customer account number,
currency, account type (e.g., savings/current) and available balance. Compare available balance
against a unique combination of customer id, customer account number, account type and
currency. Generate a CSV file with records from both the files and corresponding to the
mismatched amount (i.e., balance) for the unique combination.
